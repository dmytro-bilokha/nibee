			To determine line length for optimum readability, a good guideline is between 9 and 12 words for unjustified text. Fewer words may cause the sentence structure to break up, and may also result in too many hyphenations. Both of these reduce readability. Conversely, a line with more than 12 words can become tedious to read. Additionally, a reader can easily get lost when going from the end of one long line to the beginning of the next, and may inadvertently reread the same line, or miss a line or two.</p>
			<p>Typefaces vary in their alphabet length. The alphabet length is determined by the <em>width</em> of the lowercase a through z, historically measured in points. This measurement <em>varies</em> depending upon the typestyle and point size being used. Therefore, varying the <em>font</em> and/or point size will affect the optimum column width.</p>
			<p>The final factor to take into account when deciding upon the appropriate line length is the nature of the actual text. For instance, some content – such as medical text – might involve many longer words, lending itself to a wider column width to avoid excessive hyphenations. On the other hand, text used for children and young readers might involve many short words, allowing for a narrower column.</p>
