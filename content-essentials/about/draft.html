<p>Hello, Dear Reader!</p> 
<p> 
My name is Dmytro and I am a software engineer. At my job I develop
enterprise software using Java, SQL and Javascript languages.  I like
software development, that's why I not only enjoy it at work, but also
spend part of my spare time to develop something.
</p> 
<p> 
I started blogging, because I want to share my thougts, experience,
knowledge, opinion, doubts, etc. with someone who is also passionate about
software development. I am a big fan of the FreeBSD operational system
and activly use it at home. So, probably, will post about it too.
</p>
<p>
I hope you will find something interesting for you here.
